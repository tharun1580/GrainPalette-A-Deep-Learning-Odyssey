Problem Statement: Enhancing Autonomous Driving with Machine Learning
Problem Overview
Self-driving cars use machine learning to interpret sensor data, detect obstacles, and navigate safely. Developing a reliable autonomous driving system is challenging 
due to unpredictable road conditions, sensor limitations, and real-time decision-making constraints. Ensuring safety and efficiency requires advanced AI models that 
can generalize across diverse environments. The project aims to create an ML model that improves perception, planning, and control for autonomous vehicles. The 
ultimate goal is to minimize accidents, reduce traffic congestion, and enhance transportation efficiency.

Data Sources
Autonomous vehicle datasets can be obtained from public repositories like Waymo, KITTI, and nuScenes.
Sensor data from onboard cameras, LIDAR, and RADAR provide real-time environmental perception. GPS and IMU data help in localization and trajectory prediction.
Simulated data from platforms like CARLA can supplement real-world training.
Crowdsourced data from Tesla Autopilot or other self-driving fleets can further enhance model robustness.

Data Issues
Data imbalance occurs when certain driving conditions, such as clear weather, dominate the dataset.
Sensor noise and calibration errors can introduce inconsistencies in object detection and lane recognition. Occlusion of pedestrians, vehicles, or road signs creates challenges for accurate perception. 
Incorrect labeling in segmentation or object detection datasets can lead to biased predictions.
High computational costs associated with processing multimodal data impact real-time deployment.

Types of Data
Image data from RGB and infrared cameras assist in object detection and scene understanding. 
LIDAR point clouds provide 3D spatial information for depth estimation and obstacle detection. RADAR data captures moving objects and estimates their speed and distance. 
Time-series data from GPS and IMU sensors aid in localization and trajectory prediction. 
Annotated labels, such as bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and lane markings, are crucial for supervised learning tasks.

Conclusion
Developing an ML-based self-driving system requires high-quality, diverse, and well-annotated data. Addressing data-related challenges is essential to improve model 
accuracy and reliability. The integration of multiple sensor modalities enhances perception, planning, and control in dynamic environments. Real-world testing and 
validation are necessary to ensure safe deployment. The project aims to contribute to safer, more efficient, and fully autonomous transportation systems.
