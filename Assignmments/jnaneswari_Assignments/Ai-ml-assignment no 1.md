# Fraud Detection in Banking

## Data

### Data Sources
Fraud detection in banking relies on a variety of data sources to identify suspicious activities. These include:

- **Transaction Data:** This includes details such as transaction amounts, timestamps, locations, and the parties involved in each transaction.
- **Customer Data:** Information about customers, such as personal details, account history, and past behavior patterns, helps in understanding normal vs. abnormal activities.
- **Merchant Data:** Data related to merchants involved in transactions can provide insights into potential fraud risks.
- **External Data:** This includes credit bureau data, blacklists, and public records that help in cross-referencing and validating transactions.
- **Log Data:** System logs and access logs track user activities and can reveal unusual patterns or unauthorized access.

### Data Issues
Working with data for fraud detection comes with several challenges:

- **Imbalanced Data:** Fraudulent transactions are rare compared to legitimate ones, making it difficult to train models effectively.
- **Data Quality:** Issues like missing values, inconsistencies, and errors in transaction records can affect the accuracy of fraud detection.
- **Data Privacy:** Protecting sensitive customer information is crucial, requiring careful handling and anonymization of data.
- **Real-time Processing:** Detecting fraud in real-time requires processing large volumes of data quickly, which can be technically challenging.

### Types of Data
The data used in fraud detection can be categorized into:

- **Structured Data:** This includes well-organized data like transaction records, customer profiles, and account details.
- **Unstructured Data:** Emails, customer service interactions, and notes fall into this category and require advanced techniques to analyze.
- **Semi-structured Data:** Logs in formats like JSON or XML provide valuable insights but need preprocessing to be useful.

## Problem Statement
The primary goal is to develop a robust fraud detection system for the banking industry that can identify fraudulent transactions in real-time. The system should accurately detect suspicious activities while minimizing false positives (legitimate transactions flagged as fraud) and false negatives (fraudulent transactions that go undetected). By analyzing transaction data and identifying patterns indicative of fraud, the system will help prevent financial losses and protect customers. Integration with existing banking systems will ensure that suspicious activities are flagged or blocked promptly.
